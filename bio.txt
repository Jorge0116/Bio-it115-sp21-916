My name is Jorge Celestino and I am from Washington. I am currently a student in the Year Up Program at Seattle Central Community College, where I study Software Development and Testing. In my experience of working in agriculture, I have planted, harvested, and stored crops using heavy machinery. Having worked with such machinery, I understand the need to improve the equipment to be more efficient. With both my experience and my current education track, I would be a great fit for your company in developing software and hardware that will benefit the agriculture partnerships your company currently has. Thank you for your time.
